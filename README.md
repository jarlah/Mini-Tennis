# Mini-Tennis

Developed in Scala IDE. I haven't bothered creating an SBT project of this as of yet. 

To run this import the eclipse project into Scala IDE and run it from there.

Instructions:

- Pause the game with SPACE
- Resume the game with SPACE
- Left arrow moves racquet to the left
- Right arrow moves the racquet to the right

Music will stop when paused. And resume from last position when resumed.

A game over sound will play when the ball hits the bottom screen, after the music has stopped.
